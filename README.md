# James Benjamin Pawlik #
  
Thank you for visiting the home of my personal and professional programming projects. If you love what you see and cannot get enough, [send cash and job offers](james.benjamin.pawlik@gmail.com) or link up with me on everyone's favorite necessary evil, [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/jbpawlik). 
  
I am a software developer transitioning from a career in education. I'm interested in positions that combine programming with human development, education/training, art, writing, and/or design. I am a strong team member, quick learner, and proficient communicator. I would love to find a position that encourages collaboration on challenging, useful applications with an aim towards improving the general happiness and productivity of humanity. 

  I am always looking for collaborators or clients. My interests are in art, design, full-stack development, and obscure/arcane computer games (DCSS fork, anyone?).
