I am a software developer transitioning from a career in education. One of my main interests at this time is mobile development using React Native. I'm interested in positions that combine programming with human development, education/training, art, writing, and/or design. I am a strong team member, quick learner, and proficient communicator. I would love to find a position that encourages collaboration on challenging, useful applications with an aim towards improving the general happiness and productivity of humanity.

# Recent Projects:
  
  ### [SwimNW](https://github.com/jbpawlik/SwimNW)
A cross-platform mobile app designed for hydrophiles living in or traveling to the Pacific Northwest. Users can sign up, see swimming spots, and add their own. Due to the sensitive nature of disclosing private swimming holes, SwimNW has a circle-of-trust system whereby users who contribute to the site can access swims marked as Protected, or enter Private swims that only they can access. Soon to be available on Google Play and the App Store.

  ### [OKBloomer](http://okbloomer.herokuapp.com/)
An app for tracking the health of a user's plants. This was a team project at Epicodus. I set up the app's CRUD functionality, made the plant profile pages, and created the messaging system. I also created and styled all of the user profile and message-related pages. I wrote the script that calls an API to retrieve plant data and made the graphs that appear on the plant profiles. To log in to the Heroku deployment of OKBloomer, use the email 'test@test.com' and the password 'User2002!'
